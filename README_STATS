This will PV'ize the statistics as returned in the sequencer iocSh command 'seqcar'. The PVs are:

    yourIOC:nPgms       <- the number of seq state programs
    yourIOC:nChans      <- the number of channels
    yourIOC:nConnect    <- the number of connected channels
    yourIOC:nDisconnect <- the number of disconnected channels

To include this in your application add the the following  to your application's 'xxxApp/src/Makefile'.

    yourapplication_LIBS += seqCar

and this to your 'xxxApp/src/xxxInclude.dbd'.

    include "devSeqCar.dbd"

and this to your xxxApp/Db/Makefile

    DB_INSTALLS += $(SNCSEQ)/db/devSeqCar.db

Add the following to your IOC startup.

    dbLoadRecords("db/devSeqCar.db", "SIOC=yourIOCname")
